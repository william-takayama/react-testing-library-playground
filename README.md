## :rocket: Goal:
  Solidify my knowlodge using tests while using react-testing-library
  
## :chart_with_upwards_trend: What I've learned or improved on my knowledge: 
  - How to create a custom Hook and tested it
  - Testing two simple components with its own functionalities
  - Good practices while using data-testid
  - Use afterEach(cleanup) to clean the component and render it again
  - How to use fireEvent in input elements and buttons
  - The importance to use async function while using waitForElement
  - Trying some different "expects"
  
## :feet: How to clone or run?
  - Download the zip or clone using github
